* markdown: no support for footnotes and tables
* latex: no support for links and images
* odt: no support for... a lot of stuff, actually
* config: can't handle multiline string (and really, isn't there
  an existing format for that?)
* config: can't parse specified numbers for negative chapter (is it
  really a bug?)
