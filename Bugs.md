Bugs 
====

* epub: what happens if cover point to "../foo" or "/foo/bar"? nothing
  good, I fear...
* epub: chapters that aren't numbered still appear numbered in the TOC
* epub: no way to embed custom files to epub
* epub: toc.ncx currently only displays chapters (first level headers)
* latex: support for images is not good
* odt: no support for... a lot of stuff, actually
* config: can't parse specified numbers for negative chapter (is it
  really a bug?)
