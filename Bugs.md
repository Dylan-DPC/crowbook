Bugs 
====

* html/epub: numbering is limited to first level
* epub: no way to embed custom files to epub
* no support for footnotes and tables (but I don't even know how to
make them in Markdown)
* latex: no support for links and images
* latex: characters are not escaped for LaTeX, which
  sometimes causes issues, particularly when there is code/formula
* config: can't handle multiline string (and really, isn't there
  an existing format for that?)
* config: can't parse specified numbers for negative chapter (is it
  really a bug?)
