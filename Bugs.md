Bugs 
====

* html/epub: numbering is limited to first level
* epub: no way to embed custom files to epub
* latex: no support for links and images
* odt: no support for... a lot of stuff, actually
* config: can't handle multiline string, which is a problem for fields
  like "desscription"
* config: can't parse specified numbers for negative chapter (is it
  really a bug?)
