Roadmap 
=======

This is a list of features I'd like for 1.0:

* stable option names
* stable API? (or separate crowbook as a library from the binary)
* more extended documentation
* a french version of the documentation
* support for parts (see issue
  [#19](https://github.com/lise-henry/crowbook/issues/19))

Possible post-1.0:

* real support for ODT
* download external images and embed them
