Roadmap 
=======

List of features needed for 1.0 release:

* Stable option names
* Stable API
* Complete documentation
* A french version of the documentation

Not really blocking (can happen after 1.0 without being breaking):

* Support for parts (see issue
  [#19](https://github.com/lise-henry/crowbook/issues/19))
* Real support for ODT
* Download external images and embed them
* Option to prepend/append code to templates (see issue
  [#18](https://github.com/lise-henry/crowbook/issues/18))
* Fix toc.ncx rendering for Epub (see issue [#7](https://github.com/lise-henry/crowbook/issues/7))
