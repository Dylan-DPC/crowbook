Roadmap 
=======

List of features needed for 1.0 release:

* Stable option names
* Stable API
* Documented and stable exported names accessible from templates
* Complete documentation
* A french version of the documentation
* Support for parts (see issue
  [#19](https://github.com/lise-henry/crowbook/issues/19))

Not really blocking (can happen after 1.0 without being breaking):

* Demo as webservice
* Support for internationalization
* Real support for ODT
* Download external images and embed them
* Tex-like ligatures (see issue
  [#17](https://github.com/lise-henry/crowbook/issues/17))
* Option to prepend/append code to templates (see issue
  [#18](https://github.com/lise-henry/crowbook/issues/18))
* Work on error messages (see issue
  [#15](https://github.com/lise-henry/crowbook/issues/15)
* Fix toc.ncx rendering for Epub (see issue [#7](https://github.com/lise-henry/crowbook/issues/7))
