The configuration file
======================

If you want to use Crowbook for your book, this configuration file
is all you'll have to add (assuming you'll already have the book in
Markdown files; if you don't, you'll also have to write a book first,
but that's besides the scope of this document).

The format is not very complicated, and it looks a bit like YAML. This is an example of it:

```
# metadata
author: Joan Doe
title: Some book
lang: en

output.html: some_book.html

# list of chapters
- preface.md
+ chapter_1.md
+ chapter_2.md
+ chapter_3.md
+ chapter_4.md
- epilogue.md
```
Basically, it is divided in two parts:

* a list of options, under the form `key: value`;
* a list of Markdown files.

Files starting with the `#` characters are comments and are discarded
by Crowbook when parsing the files. Note that `#` must be at the
*beginning* of the line, so e.g.:

```
author: John Smith # aka John Doe
```

will set the `author` key to `John Smith # aka John Doe`.

The list of files
-----------------

There are various options to include a markdown file.

* `+ file_name.md` includes a numbered chapter.
* `- file_name.md` includes an unnumbered chapter.
* `! file_name.md` includes a chapter whose title won't be displayed
  (except in the toc for epub); this is useful for e.g. including a
  copyright at the beginning or the book, or for short stories where
  there is only one chapter.
* `42. file_name.md` specifies the number for a chapter.

So a typical usage might look like this:

```
! copyright.md
- preface.md
# We want first chapter to be Chapter 0 because we are programmers!
0. chapter_0.md
# Next chapters can be numbered automatically
+ chapter_1.md
+ chapter_3.md
...
```

There are two important things to note:

1. you must *not* use quotes around the file names
2. the path of these files are relative to the directory where your
   config file is, *not* to the directory where you are when running
   `crowbook`. E.g. you can run `crowbook
   books/my_trilogy/first_book/config.book` without being in the
   book's directory.

Also note that you don't have to specify a title. This is because the title
of the chapter is inferred from the Markdown document. To go back to
our previous example:

```
+ chapter_1.md
```

does not specify a chapter title, because it will read it directly in
`chapter_1.md`, e.g.:

```markdown
The day I was born
==================

...
```

You should have one and only one level-one header (i.e. chapter title)
in each markdown file.

If you have more than one, Crowbook won't get too angry at you and
will just print a warning and treat it as another chapter (numbered
according to the scheme specified for including the file). It will
however mess the table of contents if Crowbook tries to generate one
(e.g. for Epub). 

It's also a problem if you do *not* have a level-1 header in a
markdown file. If it is a numbered chapter Crowbook will still be
able to infer a chapter name, but if it is not numbered Crowbook
will fail to generate an Epub file.

****

So, to sum it up. *please*: one file = one chapter, a chapter starts with a
title, and this way this will work nice.


Crowbook options 
----------------

The first part of the configuration file is dedicated to pass options
to Crowbook. Each one is of the form `option: value`. Note that you
don't have to put string in quotes, e.g.:

```
title: My title
```

If you *do* use quotes, Crowbook will actually put those quotes in the
string, so basically don't do that.

It is possible to use multiline strings with either `>` or `|`, and
then indenting the lines that are part of the string:

```
title: >
 A
 long
 title
author: Joan Doe
```

will set `title` to `"A long title"`, whereas

```
title: >
 A
 long
 title
author: Joan Doe
```

will set `title` to `"A\nlong\ntitle\n"` (replicating line returns).

This feature is useful for options like `description` who may take a
long string.

Here is the complete list of options, with a short description. The

Note that these options take a type, which in most case should be
pretty straightforward (a boolean can be `true` or `false`, an integer
must be composed a number, a string is, well, any string, just
remember not to put the quotes). The `path` type might puzzle you a
bit, but it's equivalent a string, except Crowbook will consider it
relatively to the book file.


### Output options ###

These options specify which files to generate. You must at least set
one of this option, or Crowbook won't do anything.

Recall that all file paths are relative to the directory where the
config file is, not to the one where you run `crowbook`. So if you set

```
output.epub = foo.epub
```

and runs

```bash
$ crowbook some/dir/config.book
```

`foo.epub` will be generated in `some/dir`, not in your current
directory.

Crowbook will try to generate each of the `output.xxx` files that are
specified. That means that you'll have to set at least one of those if you want a call to

```
$ crowbook my.book
```

to generate anything. (It's still possible to generate a specific
format, and only this one, by using the `--to` argument on the command
line).

Note that some formats depend on some commands being installed on your
system. Most notably, Crowbook depends on LaTeX (`pdflatex` by
default, though you can specify the command to use with `tex.command`) to generate a PDF file,
so PDF rendering won't work if it is not installed on your
system. Crowbook also uses the `zip` command to generate the EPUB and
ODT, files.
want to use.)

### Generic options for rendering  ###

#### numbering ####

An integer that represents the maximum level of numbering for your
book. E.g., `1` will only number chapters, while `2` will number
chapters, sections, but not anything below that. `6` is the maximum  level
and turns numbering on for all headers.

**default**:: `1`


#### numbering_template ####

A string that will be used for chapter titles. You can use `{{number}}` and
`{{title}}` in this string, e.g.:

```
numbering_template: Chapter {{number}} {{title}}
```

Note that:
* this string isn't used for unnumbered chapters;
* this string isn't used by LaTeX, either.

#### autoclean ####

This option cleans a bit the input markdown. With the default
implementation, it only removes consecutive spaces, which has not real
impact (they are ignored anyway both by HTML viewers and by LaTeX).

However, if `lang` is set to `fr`, it also tries to add non-breaking
spaces in front (or after) characters like '?', '!', ';' to respect
french typography.

#### nb_char ####

This option allows you to specify the non breaking character used by
the french cleaning method (see above). Probably not really something
you need to modify. 


### Additional options ###

#### temp_dir ####

When it is generating epub or pdf files, Crowbook creates a temporary
directory (which is then removed), named from a random uuid (so we can
be pretty certain it's not gonna exist). By default, it uses Rust's
[`std::env::temp_dir`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/fn.temp_dir.html)
function, which should an appropriate place for temporary files, so
you probably won't have to use this option.
